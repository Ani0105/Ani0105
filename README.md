🚀 I build full-stack and AI systems where Python, FastAPI, React, and cloud turn real-world problems into automated software.
🧩 I design APIs, databases, and UIs that make data flow clean, fast, and reliable at scale.
🧠 I use machine learning, NLP, and semantic search (LangChain, FAISS, LLaMA) to turn documents into intelligent assistants.
☁️ I ship production systems on GCP and Docker with CI/CD so ideas become live, secure applications.
📊 From research labs to family businesses, I replace manual work with data-driven, measurable results.
✨ I don’t just write code. I build systems that think, adapt, and keep getting better.
